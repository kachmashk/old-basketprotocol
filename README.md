## About
My mobile solution for an old idea of making basketball protocols finally coming to be real thing with Flutter.
Until this time I've had in mind just 3 points contests & casual games so you won't see seperated rebounds for defense & offense, players substitutions or fouls and free throws.
All of that should be added in the future for the release. You can look up everything in ToDo section.
